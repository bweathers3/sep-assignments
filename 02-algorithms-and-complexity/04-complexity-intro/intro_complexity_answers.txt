1) So in swimming an O(1) case might be Michael Phellps and an O(2n) case might be someone who does not know how to swim.

2) A best case scenario for a binary search is equal to the number of 1, you find the element the first time.

3) A worst case scenario for a binary search, where each time you narrow the search by half the
     remaining elements, so if you had 128 it would be 128 then 64 then 32 then 18 then 9 then
      5 then 3 then 1. So 8.

4) A bounded case would be the middle between the best and worse case. So for the example of
      binary search of 128 elements it would be 4.

5) Done will pass google drive link in submission note.

6) Basically at some point it would look like a very straight line going straight up.

7) O(n log n).

8)
      for n in 1..x do
        puts n
      end

9) See addition work with google drive doc above

10) The Big-O of binary search = O(log n).

11) The Big-Omega of a binary search = O(1).

12) The Big-Theta of a binary search = Ó¨(log(n)).
