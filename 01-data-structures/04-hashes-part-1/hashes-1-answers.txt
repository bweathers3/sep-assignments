1) "Double sizing" the array will reduce the cost of running the method
  as the array worked with increases.

  Increasing the size of the array is effective in avoiding collisions; the
   goal is then to increase the size in as small increments as possible.

2) The size of the index array can also reduce system performance as the number of index
  locations in the array without assigned values grows. The goal is to provide a larger pool
  of index locations to prevent collisions while maintaining an efficient access to the array.
