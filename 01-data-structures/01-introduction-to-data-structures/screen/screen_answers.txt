1)
In this exercise we again used arrays as the data structure.
Here I used a two dimensional arrays. The arrays were set to the screen size given.
Developers can access the data using x,y coordinates.
2)
Since the color coded data can be repeated for any number of locations data search would focus
  on locations rather than the values. The primary need is the have quick access to change the color data.
3)
Other than screens other uses of this type of grid would include video games, data point location,
  touch screens, etc.
